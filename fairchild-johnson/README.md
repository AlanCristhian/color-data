The article is concerned with the question which printed color corresponds to which
color on a CRT screen.

Abstract:
A colorimetrically calibrated CRT display was used to measure constant perceptual hue
surfaces in color space. Three hundred six points over fifteen equally spaced hue
angles (every 24 degrees) in CIELAB color space were sampled. An average of 20
lightness-chroma combinations per reference hue plane was sampled. Thirty observers
performed the matching task three times each. Intra-observer variation was used to
weight mean observer hue matches for each of 306 colors. Analysis of perceived hue
uniformity was performed in CIELAB and CIECAM97s color spaces. Other constant hue
experimental results are analyzed and compared to data obtained here.

Data retrieved from <http://www.rit-mcsl.org/fairchild/CAM.html>.

The data consist of normalized CIE 2-deg. XYZ tristimulus values for the printed
images, the D65-CRT matches, and the D50-CRT matches. These data have been averaged
across observers and trials. The data for all scenes is incorporated into a single
column of 110 data points with the following parsing:
1-16: pinklady
17-40: barn
41-59: fruit
61-85: colorchecker
86-110: golfer
